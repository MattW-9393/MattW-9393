# 🧠 Matt Warne — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code behind my personal website — a space to share my journey as a self-taught developer, showcase what I’ve built, and dive deeper into how I solve problems (usually with a keyboard and a lot of coffee ☕).

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer with a background in IT Support, passionate about solving complex problems with simple, scalable solutions. I thrive in high-ownership environments and love building tools that improve real-life workflows — from budgeting to fitness to mental wellbeing.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably watching cricket, training Muay Thai, or gaming — because a healthy mind needs a high frame rate.
