# 🧠 Matt Warne — Personal Portfolio

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer with a background in IT Support, passionate about solving complex problems with simple, scalable solutions. I thrive in high-ownership environments and love building tools that improve real-life workflows — from budgeting to fitness to mental wellbeing.

My current full-time role is as an IT Service Delivery Manager; ensuring my organisation are continuing to innovate and improve existing tools, processes and procedures - maximising CX. However I'm looking to make the move into a more hands-on technical space. Currently as part of my role I'm working towards the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification.

When I’m not working or coding, I’m probably watching cricket (sometimes playing if it's not raining!), training Muay Thai, or gaming — because a healthy mind needs a high frame rate.
