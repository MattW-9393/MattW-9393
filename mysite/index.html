                <p>Before my shift to programming I spent over half a decade in IT Support. During that time I held multiple roles ranging from Service Desk Analyst to IT management roles. As an IT Manager I held roles responsible for line management of Service Desk staff, and as a quality, compliance and service transition manager.</p>
